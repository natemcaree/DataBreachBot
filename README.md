# DataBreachBot

This databreach bot was created using Twitter's API. The idea behind this bot was to scrape tweets using stems of 
words like "breaching", "breached", etc. and summize them into "breach". After these tweets were scraped, I wanted to visualize the data using numpy and seaborn. The graph you see on these tweets is the culmination of what has been trending and using the keyword stems. 
I had plans to tag and attach company names to the tweets to make an actual monitor for company breaches, except got busy then was paywalled by Twitter unfortunately.
